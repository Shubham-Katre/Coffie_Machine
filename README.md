## OOPS Concepts Used

In the Coffee Machine Simulator code provided, several Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) concepts have been utilized. Here are the OOP concepts used in the implementation:

1. Classes and Objects:
   - The `CoffeeMachine` class represents the coffee machine and encapsulates its state and behavior.
   - The `Main` class contains the main method and serves as the entry point of the program.

2. Encapsulation:
   - The `CoffeeMachine` class encapsulates the internal state of the coffee machine, such as the amounts of water, milk, coffee beans, and money.
